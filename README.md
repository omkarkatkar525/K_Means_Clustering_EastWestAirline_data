# Clustering
There are Three types of Regressions.

1.Hierarchical Clustering

2.K-Means Clustering

3.Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)

## K-Means Clustering:
```sh
K Value : No. of Clusters And based on the k value, Divide the entire dataset in k divisions.
Steps in Kmeans Clustering:

1. Compute the centroid for each group.
2. Find out the distance of each data point from the cluster centroid. 
3. Move the data points to the nearest cluster centroid.
4. Due to this repositioning we have to recomputed the centroid.
5. Repeat the 2 to 4, until we don't need to move any data point to any other clusters.

Goal: All the data points should have minimum distance from its cluster centroid.
```

## Data Used :
```sh
EastWestAirlines: Airlines data to obtain optimum number of clusters.

```  
## Programming:
```sh
Python
```
